# FITBIT-at-LOCKDWON
This little project is a result of the Covid-19 lockdown in the UK. 
Swimming pools are shut down. Swimming and timing laps is impossible. 
I used a Fitbit Inspire HR to time cycling and walking during this year.
The data is a year of my heart-rate data during these activities. 
Comments are welcomed!
