# FITBIT-at-LOCKDWON
This little fun project is a result of the Covid-19 lockdown in the UK. 
Swimming pools are shut down, so my favourite activity of swimming and timing laps is impossible. 
As a substitute, I used a Fitbit Inspire HR to time cycling and walking.
The data is my heart-rate json files during this year. I find out that repeating short 
cycling sprints or laps is the most energetic type of activity. Almost like swimming :) 

The Jupyter notebooks are as follows:

daily-JSON-to-activity-DF  -- process the JSON files that Fitbit gives and creates 'activity' dataframes and summaries; these are stored as pickle files

activity-summary-plot -- plots some of the summary statistics of the activities

activity-heart-rate-plot -- plots the full heart rate for some interesting activities

fitbit-sandbox -- tries a few methods to identify cycles in the activity heart rates

best-activities -- not uploaded yet, will use the cycles to identify the 'best' activities
