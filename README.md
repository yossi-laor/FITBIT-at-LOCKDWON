# FITBIT-at-LOCKDWON
This little fun project is a result of the Covid-19 lockdown in the UK. 
Swimming pools are shut down, so my favourite activity of swimming and timing laps is impossible. 
As a substitute, I used a Fitbit Inspire HR to time cycling and walking during this year.
The data is my heart-rate json files. Analyzing these activities, I find out that cycling short 
sprints is the most energetic type of activity. Almost like a swimming pool :) Comments are welcomed!
